# roll-dice

---

A very basic, very boring dice-rolling simulator, because nobody's ever made one of those before.

Planning to build it into a Slackbot or something.

To use:

1. Clone or download it.
2. In the project directory, run `ruby roll.rb` followed by the dice command.
    - At the minimum, this must be 'd' followed by a number (eg `d8`)
    - To roll multiple dice, include a number before the 'd' (eg `2d6`)
    - For example, `ruby roll 2d20` will roll two d20s.
